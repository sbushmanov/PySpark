    "This tutorial will teach you how to use [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), a framework for large-scale data processing, within a notebook. Many traditional frameworks were designed to be run on a single computer.  However, many datasets today are too large to be stored on a single computer, and even when a dataset can be stored on one computer (such as the datasets in this tutorial), the dataset can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.\n",

Spark excels at distributing these operations across a cluster while abstracting away many of the underlying implementation details.  Spark has been designed with a focus on scalability and efficiency.  With Spark you can begin developing your solution on your laptop, using a small dataset, and then use that same code to process terabytes or even petabytes across a distributed cluster.\n",

Since no Spark functionality is actually being used, no tasks are launched on the executors.\n",

When running Spark, you start a new Spark application by creating a [SparkContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext). You can then create a [SQLContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SQLContext) from the `SparkContext`. When the `SparkContext` is created, it asks the master for some cores to use to do work.  The master sets these cores aside just for you; they won't be used for other applications. When using Databricks, both a `SparkContext` and a `SQLContext` are created for you automatically. `sc` is your `SparkContext`, and `sqlContext` is your `SQLContext`."

    "\n",
    "When you use DataFrames or Spark SQL, you are building up a _query plan_. Each transformation you apply to a DataFrame adds some information to the query plan. When you finally call an action, which triggers execution of your Spark job, several things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spark's Catalyst optimizer analyzes the query plan (called an _unoptimized logical query plan_) and attempts to optimize it. Optimizations include (but aren't limited to) rearranging and combining `filter()` operations for efficiency, converting `Decimal` operations to more efficient long integer operations, and pushing some operations down into the data source (e.g., a `filter()` operation might be translated to a SQL `WHERE` clause, if the data source is a traditional SQL RDBMS). The result of this optimization phase is an _optimized logical plan_.\n",
    "2. Once Catalyst has an optimized logical plan, it then constructs multiple _physical_ plans from it. Specifically, it implements the query in terms of lower level Spark RDD operations.\n",
    "3. Catalyst chooses which physical plan to use via _cost optimization_. That is, it determines which physical plan is the most efficient (or least expensive), and uses that one.\n",
    "4. Finally, once the physical RDD execution plan is established, Spark actually executes the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can examine the query plan using the `explain()` function on a DataFrame. By default, `explain()` only shows you the final physical plan; however, if you pass it an argument of `True`, it will show you all phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you want to take a deeper dive into how Catalyst optimizes DataFrame queries, this blog post, while a little old, is an excellent overview: [Deep Dive into Spark SQL's Catalyst Optimizer](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/13/deep-dive-into-spark-sqls-catalyst-optimizer.html).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add a couple transformations to our DataFrame and look at the query plan on the resulting transformed DataFrame. Don't be too concerned if it looks like gibberish. As you gain more experience with Apache Spark, you'll begin to be able to use `explain()` to help you understand more about your DataFrame operations."

Let's look at what happens when we do a basic operation on the dataset.  Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the dataset\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can parallelize the operation.\n",

    "One of the most common DataFrame operations is `select()`, and it works more or less like a SQL `SELECT` statement: You can select specific columns from the DataFrame, and you can even use `select()` to create _new_ columns with values that are derived from existing column values. We can use `select()` to create a new column that decrements the value of the existing `age` column.\n",

But it does *not* actually execute anything on the cluster. When transforming DataFrames, we are building up a _query plan_.
